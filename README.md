## Gameplay

The game is simple. You have to guess the word by guessing letters. You have 8 chances to guess the word. Each incorrect guess will deduct a life. Once you have no lives left, the game is over. The game is highly responsive and made to work on all devices. The game is divided into 3 pages:

1. **Start Page**: This page is where you select the topic for the word. You can choose from Animal, Space, Food, or Country. Once you have chosen a topic, you will be redirected to the next page.

2. **Play Page**: This is the main game page. Here you will see the word you have to guess. You will also see the number of lives you have left. You can click on the letters to guess the word. If you guess the word correctly, you win. If you guess the word incorrectly, you will deduct a life.

3. **Select Page**: This page is where you choose the topic for the next game. Once you have chosen a topic, you will be redirected to the start page.
